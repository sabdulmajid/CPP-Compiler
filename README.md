# C++ Compiler
A comprehensive, custom-built compiler for a subset of the **C++** programming language, designed to optimize **performance** and enhance code **efficiency**. This project encompasses a full-featured **compiler pipeline**, including **lexical analysis**, **assembling**, **parsing**, **semantic analysis**, and **code generation**. 

## Features
- **Lexical Analysis**: Accurate tokenization of C++ code into meaningful symbols
- **Assembler**: Efficiently translates assembly code into executable machine code
- **Parsing**: Robust syntax analysis using LR(1) parsing
- **Semantic Analysis**: In-depth validation of syntax trees against C++ language rules
- **Code Generation**: Generation of efficient machine code for MIPS

## Contact to View Source Code
Due to the proprietary nature and extensive effort involved in developing this suite, access to the source code is restricted under intellectual property considerations. For inquiries or interest in collaboration, please reach out directly. I am currently working on implementing newer C++ features such as classes, structured binding, and concepts, and any suggestions for improvement are highly appreciated. Please [contact me](mailto:a6abdulm@uwaterloo.ca).
